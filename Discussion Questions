Discussion Questions

Recursion

1) Recursion occurs when a function calls itself within itself. It is useful
    because you don't necessarily need to know everything about what you're
    recursing on. Recursion can provide instances of runtime improvements, but
    at the expense of memory because of increased use of the function call stack.

2) It's necessary to have a base case to ensure that recursion won't continue
    indefinitely. The recursion must progress towards an end point, like a while
    loop must progress towards a terminating case. This is achieved because the base case is fundamentally different than other cases. It can be degenerate,
    such as an empty list, at which recursion could not continue because there
    is nothing more to recurse on. Other bases cases must be more explicit.


Graphs

1) A graph is a data structure made up of nodes and edges. Nodes contain
    information about what other nodes they share an edge with (also said, are
    adjacent to), meaning they are connected to one another. The information
    about its defined relationships is stored in an adjacency list on each node.

2) A tree is different than a graph in that it's nodes can only have one parent,
    whereas nodes in a graph can have multiple parents. This also means that 
    graphs can have cycles (directed graph), whereas trees are more structured
    and each node can only be reached by one path. Graphs can also be define 
    relationships (undirected).

3) Because graphs are good for defining relationships, they are used for social
    media platforms like Facebook.
